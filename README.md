# AVL-tree
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node is no more than one. This balance is maintained through rotations during insertions and deletions, ensuring  𝑂(log𝑛) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
